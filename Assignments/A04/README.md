### Overview
FreeVerb is an open source algorithm for implementing and applying reverb to recorded audio.
It is a type of Shroeder reverb that utilizes fast fourier transformations to take the processing speed from O(n^2) down to O(n*Log(n)) where n is the size of your input buffer.
The algorithm is open source and can be built to work in most DAWs (digital audio workstations) such a Reaper, Live, Logic, ect.
